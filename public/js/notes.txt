node.js notes

vars are not global by default
functions are not global by default
every file is a module, and contains the scope of the vars and functions in it

Node wraps every module with function: exports, require, module __filename, __dirname


ARCHITECTURE::::

server.js
    Creates and keeps list of all:
        players
        projectiles
        objects

game.js
    Takes list of all () from server
        players
        projectiles
        objects
    And updates local list.
    Must assign physics sprite to all objects given from server.
